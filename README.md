# Mini-Project
Integrating modern technology with traditional 
healthcare practices, like Ayurveda, becomes essential in 
the wake of global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In order to take into account the pandemic's influence on 
healthcare decision-making, this study suggests an 
Ayurvedic Medicine Recommendation System that uses 
patient sentiment analysis through sophisticated 
vectorization. The technology attempts to forecast emotions 
and responsibly suggest Ayurvedic medications by 
examining patient reviews; this highlights the significance 
of expert medical advice. By giving patients enlightening 
information, enhancing decision-making, and possibly 
saving money and time, sentiment analysis transforms the 
healthcare industry. Both patients and healthcare 
professionals stand to gain from the system's harmonious 
fusion of contemporary medicine and Ayurvedic knowledge.
